*The main goal of this project is practicing on deep learning, NLP and words vectorization*
*I used the Twitter Dataset as the texts I would be dealing with in my main project is normal chit-chat sentences or texts not explicit reviews, hence I need to deduce if I should receive the user's input positively or negatively to proceed to further steps*
